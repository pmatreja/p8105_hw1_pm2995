Problem 1
=========

#### Creation of a Data Frame

``` r
set.seed(1)
df_1 = tibble( 
       random_samp = runif(10,0,5),
       greater_than_2 = random_samp > 2,
       student_name = c("Emma", "Sophia", "Serra", "Elisa", "John", "Jessica","Ross","Kaity", "Jo","Luke"),
       study_year = factor(c("First" , "First", "Second", "First", "Third", "Second", "Second", "Third", "First", "First"))
)
```

#### Mean of each variable in Data Frame

-   Mean of random sample is 2.7575694

-   Mean of the logical vector greater\_than\_2 is 0.6

-   Mean of character variable is NA

-   Mean of factor variable is NA

Mean command did not work for variable student\_name and study\_year as they both are not numeric and logical variables respectively whose mean can be taken.

#### Applying as.numeric function

``` r
as.numeric(df_1$random_samp)
as.numeric(df_1$greater_than_2)
as.numeric(df_1$student_name)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(df_1$study_year)
```

The as.numeric function worked for all the variables except the character variable (student\_name). For character variable it gave the warning: NAs introduced by coercion.
